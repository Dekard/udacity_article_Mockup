Your response goes here!
1.I learned superscript. :) Didn’t use that before in my learning. Been spending much of my time in JavaScript tutorials lately so glad to brush off a bit of the rust in my HTML knowledge. 
2. Mostly just refresher, but headings are pretty easy to pick out, much of this section will be refresher, CSS will start learning a bit more again and then again in JS sections.
3. Nothing much as of yet, it’s great to learn to make the mockup as perfect as possible as that is what we will be doing in our jobs most likely. 
4. The problem solving strategies has helped already because I had to look up ways to create items in the mock up I wasn’t aware of previously.
